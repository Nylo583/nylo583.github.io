                &emsp;During my time as a software engineer on my high school's robotics team (Robostangs #548), there was a great need by admin to 
                migrate away from paper attendance forms as they often got lost, damaged, or were incorrectly filled out. Since nobody on the team had any 
                actual interest in teaching me how to program the competition robot, I took it upon myself to create a virtual way for admin to track the team's 
                attendance.

            <div class="col mt-4">
                &emsp;This was right around my completion of AP CSA, so I decided to program it in Java using JavaFX as my application and graphics library.
                On the home screen, I used Google's OAuth 2.0 API to get access to the user's Google Sheets directory. The password entered into the home screen 
                corresponded with the ID of the relevant spreadsheet. This data was stored in teams.txt, and honestly I regret not including a workflow for adding
                and removing password-ID pairs. Instead, the user has to do it themselves by adding a line following the format [password]|[ID]. This breaks the 
                design philosophy that the user should not have to do any work for the app outside of the app itself.
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col mt-4">
                &emsp;Once the user has signed in, the app pulls the previous data from the spreadsheet. If I had more time, I would add validity checking for the
                spreadsheet, but for now it is just a hardcoded layout. From the main page, the app obtains each student's data and hours, storing them locally.
                At the same time, the user fills out information about the current event that students will sign in to. Options exist for min/max hours, event grouping
                type (for data collection), and time rounding. 
            </div>
            <div class="col mt-4">
                &emsp;The actual event page is populated with buttons for each student to sign into. There's also an admin sign-in workflow to edit the event,
                fix mistakes made by students, and end the event. Ending the event updates each student's local data, which is sent through the Sheets API and populated
                back into the spreadsheet. Then, the relevant event group pages are updated, and a separate page for just the event is created and populated.
            </div>
            <div class="col mt-4">
                &emsp;The parent repository that exists within my team's GitHub is private, so I can't post a link. I'll try to figure out a way to upload the code 
                separately in the future.
