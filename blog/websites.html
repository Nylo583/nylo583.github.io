                    &emsp;This website was originally created for my high school's Computer
                     Science Honor Society, which I was lucky to be a co-vice president of 
                     in its initial years. The website itself was just a bunch of static pages
                     that would be used to display news, check volunteering hours, and contact
                     leadership. This was my first real foray into actual web + graphic design,
                     and while the site never launched, I do consider it to have been a good
                     instructional experience.

                    &emsp;-- Northville Mobile Detailing<br>
                    &emsp;Done as freelance work during my sophomore and junior years of high school,
                    I worked with a small-scale family business to create a website for their detailing
                    services. The project initially began with a modern, techy look that tried to
                    encapsulate the feel of their cutting-edge cleaning technology.

                    &emsp;This version
                    was unfortunately scrapped as the clients put the job on hold for around a year,
                    and I ended up redesigning the entire site into a cleaner, more professional look.
                    On the final version of the site, you can see a completely custom responsive design
                    including a collapsing navbar and a custom image carousel. You can view the full website

                    &emsp;-- TeamButter (Internship @ Cimulus, Inc.)<br>
                    &emsp;This was part of my high school's internship program, which I participated in
                    during my final semester. I was able to secure the internship with a small-scale software
                    solutions company in Ann Arbor. Part of my internship schedule included a rotation of duties
                    until I found a good place within the company, and I ended up landing in ASP.NET MVC Core
                    development. My main task over these fifteen or so weeks was to migrate a live-service website
                    from Blazor to MVC Core as the maintenance of the current site was far too much. Over the course 
                    of the internship, I successfully migrated the DIY subdomain -- that is, the workflow you enter
                    when signing into the page -- and linked the frontend forms to the underlying databases. While I 
                    won't provide screenshots as this is proprietary code, you can visit the non-migrated site 
                    <a href="https://teambutter.com">here</a>.

                    &emsp;-- Personal Website<br>
                    &emsp;I have designed many iterations of a personal portfolio website, with the oldest ranging back 
                    to around 2021. The only one that has ever made it to the actual internet, besides this one, was the 
                    personal website I designed in my junior year. The website features a one-page layout with scroll snapping,
                    an interactible gallery, and most impressively, a projects page that loaded separate posts using only CSS 
                    (I was once a JavaScript hater). As you might be able to tell from the video below, however, the site layout
                    did not lend itself nicely to be made responsive, triggering the development of my current site.

                    &emsp;This site, taking note of the failures of the last, uses Bootstrap 5 to cleanly display my content
                    responsively. The gallery is a Masonry layout combined with responsive Bootstrap scaling. In the future, 
                    I am considering writing a custom script to load projects and blogs automatically, instead of hardcodoing them.
