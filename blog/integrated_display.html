                &emsp;For my e-bike project team's next racing bike, I took on the job of designing the integrated dashboard display after 
                being the only new member interested in tackling the two-year long project (coincidentally, my work on this project landed me 
                the low voltage hardware lead after only a year on the team).
                Essentially, it's the driver's HUD for everything happening on the bike: speed, RPM, coolant temperature and other sensor readouts. 
                It also doubles as a centralized data hub for all the low voltage sensors onboard, sending live telemetry data back to the pit 
                throughout the race.

                &emsp;The backbone of the system is a custom board built around the Raspberry Pi CM5, with a display mounted directly on its back via an FFC connector. 
                Offboard sensors feed in over CAN, and we added an IMU and GPS module onboard for position and motion tracking. All of that data gets compiled 
                in real time and piped out the back of the bike via an SMA cable to a stub antenna, which transmits everything over the 400 MHz band 
                back to the pit computer. There, a Yagi antenna carrier board (2025 new member project, coming soon) plugged in by USB intercepts the data
                and logs it.

                &emsp;Right now, the display itself hasn't been manufactured yet. The design's finalized and ready to be transferred to a board layout, but we're 
                still waiting on bike design specs from mechanical to give us a better idea about the kind of space restrictions and whatnot we have to work around. 
                I'm honestly super excited to see it all in action on FBS 2.

            <div class="col my-4">
                &emsp;I'll probably do a follow-up post when the board is manufactured and we get the system tested, but for now, it's one of the largest hardware 
                designs I've worked on. It's also the first time I've gotten to play around with radio telemetry and CAN integration at this scale, 
                and it's wild how many things start to come into play when working on a project as large and important as this.
